This dashboard will allow you to examine demographic variables 
        based on union membership.

information.

The demographics chosen for this demonstration are:
- PEERNLAB union member,y/n
- HEFAMINC Household-total family income in past 12 month
- HETENURE Household-own/rent living quarters;
- HRHTYPE Household-type of family/single individual;
- PEEDUCA Demographics-highest level of school completed;
